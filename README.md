# errorR_dictionary
A easy-to-understand dictionary of R error messages.  The aim of this project is to convert typical R error messages into a more intuitive form for beginner users (e.g., undergraduate students).  To implement this, we have chosen to use the msgtools package in R (https://github.com/RL10N/msgtools) which is designed to allow for language translations and message checking for various R packages.  By creating a dictionary of simple error message translations we can leverage the power of msgtools to install a translation file (.po file) into the package directory and allow error messages to be automatically translated for beginner users by simply changing the "language" (https://github.com/RL10N/msgtools/blob/master/vignettes/Tutorial.Rmd).  

The errorR dictionary contains some error messages from popular R packages (stripped out with msgtools) for which we are accummulating translations.  Just access the excel file and provide a translation under the "Translation" column.  Note: msgtools strips out all the messages (some of which are combined in actual error messages) so some fragments are present in the current data file.
